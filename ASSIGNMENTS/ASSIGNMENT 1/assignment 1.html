        <h2 class="h1">Q1. What is HTML</h2>
        <p1 class="p1"> HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. <br>
            It structures the content on the web, using elements called "tags" to define things like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.<br>
            HTML works alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. <br> 
            Essentially, HTML provides the skeleton of a webpage, while CSS and JavaScript enhance its appearance and functionality. <br>
